I selected these methods because they are the ones that are the most mathematically intuitive to me, rather than the ones that would necessarily give the best results.  Additionally, I wrote a \"Random\" classifier, for practice and comparison.  Classifier choice takes into account size of data set and the bias and variance of that data set. Our data has ?variance and ?bias\n",

It's easy to overfit a decision tree, only to find later that it made poor predictions. It seems like it's worse if there is too much data, because as the complexity increases, it's like you're trying to force a square peg into a potentially round hole, fitwise. What that means in practice is that is too many minute subdivisions.     \n",

Such a boundary is flexible (moreso than Naive Bayes' which can only be parabolic or linear) and so for the right datasets, will be able to actually fit them. \n",

    "A weakness of KNN are when there are too many dimensions involved and it's hard for a useful distance measure to precipitate. Further, each attribute is given equal weight in the distance calculation, which can be problematic for irrelevant attributes. For this data set I feel like we have a wieldly number of dimensions which gives me faith that KNN will not become overly biased and performance wont be an issue. There is a concern that KNN will overfit the data since this method is susceptible to errors from bias when using small samples.  So I'm curious to see how it compares to the other classifiers on this fairly small dataset. \n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

We're looking at family size, age, parental income and so on. KNN is a way of taking into account all these attributes of a student at the same time and using that to give an indication of whether a student will graduate.  In essence, KNN feels like the old addage \"if it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck...it is a duck\".
